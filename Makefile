# Makefile — the local quality gate for inventory-storage.
#
# Every target below mirrors a sensor in .github/workflows/ci.yml, so the same
# feedback CI gives you post-push is available locally, pre-commit. This is the
# "keep quality left" idea from harness engineering: shift the sensors left so
# an agent (or a human) can self-correct before code leaves the machine.
#
# See CLAUDE.md -> "Local quality gate (run before every commit)".
