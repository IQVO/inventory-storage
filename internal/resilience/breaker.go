// Package resilience holds the small pieces of circuit-breaker/timeout
// policy shared by every outbound cross-context HTTP client in this
// service (ADR-0020): the shared trip condition, the Prometheus-gauge
// wiring contract, and the context-deadline-propagation helper. It is a
// top-level internal package (a sibling of internal/adapters/outbound/
// bootretry and internal/pgtx-style helpers), not a domain/application/
// adapter layer itself, so the hexagonal fitness tests place no
// restriction on who may import it — only the outbound adapters
// (facilitylayout, telemetry) do today.
//
// One gobreaker.CircuitBreaker instance is constructed PER downstream
// dependency (never one global breaker) — see
// internal/adapters/outbound/facilitylayout.NewBreakerClient, the one
// call site that builds a breaker using this package's shared tuning
// today (this service has exactly one synchronous cross-context HTTP
// client; see the ADR's "Context" section for why the Kafka-fed
// facilitycache path is a separate mechanism entirely). A slow or
// failing dependency's breaker tripping can never affect any other
// dependency's breaker or its own bulkheaded *http.Client, since each
// dependency owns its own breaker AND its own *http.Client instance.
//
// This package mirrors order-management's internal/resilience (ADR
// 0025, PR #107) verbatim — the fleet reference design for this
// rollout — so the two implementations stay byte-for-byte comparable
// across repos.
